This directory contains files pertaining the the examples in the O'Neill et al (2006) Comp. Geosci. paper. The Ellipsis3D* directory containts ellipsis input files (run by typing ./ellipsis ellipsis_input    - where ellipsis is the name of the executable, and ellipsis_input is the name of the input file). Directory also contains jpgs of what the output should look like.
The 2nd directory (opendx) contains stuff for procesing ellipsis output, and plotting it in opendx. Which is free, and very cool, and I highly recommend playing with it. (www.opendx.org).
