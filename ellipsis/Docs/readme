New and improved ellipsis3d, circa Dec 2004.
Removed some pressure bugs.
Fixed elasticity in 3D
Fixed some field boundary conditions in 3d.

To compile, go into Shell_scripts and type build_code
If all goes well, this should do it. If not, you might need to make
a machine-specific file and pass your favourite compiler flags (see egs in
this directory).

I have included the elasticity benchmark. To get this to work, however, you need to
comment out a remove_surface... call in Full_multigrid...c. 2d works great, in 3d the numerical
elasticity works well (cw analytical & 2d) but the analytical solution is off - be warned.

Included also are a preprint to a computers and geoscience paper submitted in 2005 (revised 2006). Might be useful to someone. It also describes some 3d examples that have been included in "Examples" directory.

Ellipsis3d does not have great 3d visualization capabilities. I recommend using either gmt or opendx (www.opendx.org). I've included some docs about the latter. You use nodal output directly. However, for particle data, you need to run it through a perl script (included in examples directory) to convert from binary to particle. Wouldn't try to load all the particles up at once, incidently - takes up too much memory and crashes opendx. Pick you favourite material usually works.

Ok, I don't know what I've left, but if you've got any questions, don't hesistate to contact me (Craig O'Neill), now at coneill@els.mq.edu.au.
