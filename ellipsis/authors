Ellipsis3d originated from CIItcom (CitCom version II), a multigrid
mantle convection code developed by Louis Moresi. Subsequently, Chris
Wijns contributed user-functionality and miscellaneous back end
improvements.  Later extensions to include the Cosserat continuum
theory were introduced by Frederic Dufour. The two-dimensional version
of ellipsis was extended into three dimensions by Richard Albert and
Craig O'Neill.
